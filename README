Installation:
  The UCLATools project requires cmake to build. CMAKE can be obtained at
  http://www.cmake.org/HTML/index.html or with your favorite package manager,
  e.g. macports, fink, ports, apt, etc.

  The install is standard with the default prefix of ${UCLATOOLS_SRC_DIR}.
  Basically, this means you'll find al the binaries in the source directory
  under bin.
  1. mkdir bingcc
  2. cd bingcc
  2. cmake ..
  3. make && make install

  To set a custom install path:
  1. cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local
  where "/usr/local" is your custom install path.

  For debugging output. For now, this just enables verbose output.
  1. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=Debug
